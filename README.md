# Weather Data Through Conversation

The goal of my dissertation was to explore the possibilities of using a contemporary LLM to request and present data. Weather forecasts were the form of data chosen.

The two halves of my dissertation are a Python Flask server for accessing weather data, along with LLM integration, and a React Native mobile app serving as the interface for users to communicate with the LLM.
